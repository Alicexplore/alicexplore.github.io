## About this project
This is my very first website, the first time that I am truly diving into CSS creating my own design, discovering Media Queries, working towards making this little dude responsive.
<br /><br />
It’s not flawless, no doubt about it, but I am optimistic that in my learning journey, this will serve as a foundation for something greater, surpassing the ton of white hair you can see appearing when trying to fix css. 🚀
