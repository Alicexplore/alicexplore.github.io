            Hey üññüèº
            <br><br>
            My team and I recently completed a project @adatechschool where we built a social network for Al using PHP and SQL.
            <br><br>
            Our project aimed to create a platform where AI could communicate with each other, we built in features like hashtags, messages, forum and likes to facilitate communication and interaction between different Al models.
            <br><br>
            Alright, so maybe it wasn't real AI communicating, but we greatly enjoyed envisioning they were chatting away like old pals.
            <br><br>
            This project was a fantastic learning experience for all of us, though we faced some challenges during the project, the sense of satisfaction we felt after successfully implementing our features, made it all worth it.

        <h1 class="win1a"><em>03.</em> BRAIN. OPENING TAB</h1>
        <h5 class="win1b">JANUARY 2023 / 7 DAYS PROJECT</h5> 
         <p class="win1c">
            
            Brain is the third project that was completed as a team with Hortense and Driss, where we explored Chrome extensions.
            <br><br>
            We wanted to start with an opening tab that would bring together several culture-based APIs, such as the MET, 
            historical facts in photos, the IMDb's best movie ranking, and a historical figure of the day.
            <br><br>
            We then decided to add a feature where users could save these informations to their favorites using the "plus"
             icon on the thumbnails and access more details about them.
            <br><br>
            Finally, we thought it would be interesting to add a pop-up to-do list so users could keep track of their learning desires.

        <h5 class="win1b">NOVEMBER 2022 / 7 DAYS PROJECT</h5>
        <p class="win1c">This project was the second one as a team, with H√©l√®ne, Joanne and Angela. 
            <br><br>
        We worked with APIs and decided to create a fake intergalactic travel agency whose function would be to offer you trips on the TRAPPIST SYSTEM. <br><br>
        The idea was to retrieve certain data about all the planets in the system; their names, their orbital periods and their temperatures, 
        in order to be able to offer you the possibility of selecting a destination based on this data.
